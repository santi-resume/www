            <strong>Gap Year</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            During 2019-2021 I volunteered at farms, hostels, and other places
            while travelling. In my spare time I learnt Javascript.
            As a learning exercise during this process, I {" "}
            <a href="https://misterybodon.github.io/web/">coded a blog</a>.
            Later on, this experience helped me land my first job as a Typescript Developer.

            After volunteering for Buddhist
            Centres I made a habit of meditating and breathing exercises.
            I perform this daily, early in the morning.

            <strong>Computer-Related Hobbies</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            I like to learn about programming languages. The most recent one is Rust.
            Another hobby of mine is to experiment with Arduinos or ESP32s, primarily to program its sensors.
            I also like philosophy and physics.
